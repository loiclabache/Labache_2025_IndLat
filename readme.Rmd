## Background {#background}

**Hemispheric functional complementarity** is a *core organizational principle of the human brain*, yet the extent to which lateralization in **one domain constrains that of others** remains unclear. Two main accounts have been proposed: the *causal hypothesis*, in which dominance for one function drives complementary dominance in another, and the *statistical hypothesis*, in which each function lateralizes independently. Using *multimodal fMRI in 287 participants* from the [BIL&GIN](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.02.071) cohort, **we examined whether language lateralization phenotypes, defined as typical (left-dominant) or atypical (right-dominant), predict hemispheric asymmetries in visuospatial attention and numerical cognition**. Task-based activation was measured during *line bisection, mental calculation, and numerical interval comparison*, and analyzed within domain-specific, functionally defined network atlases. Resting-state *functional connectivity* metrics were also assessed in the same networks. Across both attention and numerical domains, typical individuals for language showed stronger asymmetries, whereas atypical individuals exhibited weaker, more bilateral patterns. Critically, atypical participants did not show mirror-reversed asymmetries, and language phenotype did not influence intrinsic connectivity metrics in non-language networks. These findings **challenge** the notion that atypical lateralization represents an inversion of the canonical template and argue against a **universal reciprocal link between language dominance and other cognitive domains**. Instead, our results support a domain-specific model in which lateralization profiles are shaped by distinct developmental and functional constraints, highlighting the **need for multimodal, multi-domain approaches to brain asymmetry**.

## Code Release {#code-release}

The `Script` folder includes one `R` script: `Regression&Visualization.R`. This `R` scripts is designed to facilitate the replication of results as detailed in the `Method Section` of the **manuscript**.

Note that the `R` scripts also contain the code **to reproduce the figures found in the manuscript**. The brain renderings in the paper require [Surf Ice](https://www.nitrc.org/projects/surfice/).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Data {#data}

All the data necessary to reproduce the results are available in the `Data` folder.

-   `BIL&GIN_287participants_ALANsLUCA_TaskRest.txt` corresponds to the average brain activity of 287 participants whose language lateralization was characterized using a multi-modal approach (see [Labache, L., et al. 2020](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.58722)). The file contains one identifier column, seven demographic-related columns, and 44 dependent-variable columns. The dependent variables correspond to the average brain-activity of each considered network. They are named according to the following structure: *Atlas name* `+` (*task*; only for task-fMRI–related variables) `+` *variable type* `+` *Network name* `+` *contrast indication* (`asym` or `sum` or `nothing`). For example, `ALANs_LBJ_weighted_BOLD_ParietoFrontal_Asym` refers to the weighted BOLD asymmetry during the LBJ (Line Bisection Task) for the Parieto-frontal network of the [ALANs](https://github.com/loiclabache/ALANs_brainAtlas) atlas.
